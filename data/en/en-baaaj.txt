 Throughout their history , keyboardist Vincent Crane was the only constant member , and wrote the majority of their material . Their history is defined by two periods , in the early 1970s and the early 1980s . Their genre in music is difficult to define , since they went through radical changes in very short times during the life of the band . However , their best-known era represented a more hard rock/progressive rock sound , exemplified by their only hit singles , " Tomorrow Night " ( UK #11 ) and " The Devil 's Answer " ( UK #4 ) , both in 1971. History Original period ( 1969-1975 ) In summer 1969 , The Crazy World of Arthur Brown had to cease touring in the middle of their second US tour because of keyboardist Vincent Crane 's mental illness . When he recovered , he and drummer Carl Palmer took the step to leave Arthur Brown and return to England , the return date being Friday 13 June 1969 , which was the year of the Rooster in the Chinese calendar , and arranged a meeting with Brian Jones to discuss a collaboration . After his death , they adopted the name Atomic Rooster ( with influence from the US band Rhinoceros ) , and soon recruited Nick Graham on bass and vocals . They followed with what had emerged as The Crazy World of Arthur Brown formula of vocals , organ , bass , and drums . They soon undertook live dates around London ; at their first headlining gig the opening act was Deep Purple . They eventually struck a deal with B & C Records and began recording their debut album in December 1969. Their first LP , Atomic Roooster was released in February 1970 , along with a single , " Friday the 13th " . By March , Crane felt it was best that they add a guitarist , and recruited John Du Cann from acid/progressive rock band Andromeda . However , just as Du Cann joined , Graham left . Du Cann ( who played guitar and sang for Andromeda ) took over vocal duties , whilst Crane overdubbed the bass lines on his Hammond Organ with a combination of left hand and foot pedals . Atomic Rooster resumed gigging until the end of June , when Carl Palmer announced his departure to Emerson , Lake & Palmer . Ric Parnell filled the drum spot until August , when the young Paul Hammond was recruited from Farm to the drum spot . They then recorded their second album , Death Walks Behind You , released in September 1970. Originally it was not commercially successful , as with the first album , but by February 1971 , the single , " Tomorrow Night " reached #11 in the UK Singles Chart , with the album reaching #12 in the UK Albums Chart . Reformation period ( 1980-1983 ) During 1980 , Crane contacted Cann and after some discussion , got an Atomic Rooster reformation under way , with Cann reverting to his full surname again , as per the earlier incarnation of the band . They recruited session drummer Preston Heyman and recorded an album , along with one 7/12 " single , on EMI Records . The 1980 album , Atomic Rooster , was followed by a tour , however in October Heyman left and Paul Hammond was once again in the drum seat after Ginger Baker filled in for two weeks . They continued touring and released two singles in 1981 and 1982. However , before their performance at the Reading Festival , Du Cann became absent without official leave . John McCoy stepped in on bass . With Du Cann gone , Crane set about a new form of Atomic Rooster . Paul Hammond stayed on and played drums for the following album , recorded in late 1982. Several guitarists played on the album , including David Gilmour of Pink Floyd , Bernie Torme of Gillan and John Mizarolli . Crane added vocals to the album along with his wife adding backing vocals . A tour of Germany and Italy included Bernie Torme on guitar . Mizarolli played guitar for several U. K. dates . Headline News was released in June 1983 , and featured a completely different sound from anything they had ever done , including electronics and synthesizers . The album was completely written by Vincent Crane , leading some to perceive it as a Crane solo album . Crane disbanded Atomic Rooster once again at the end of 1983. In 1984 , he went on to the project Katmandu with Peter Green , Ray Dorset and Jeff Whittaker , and they recorded the album A Case for the Blues . In 1985 , Crane joined Dexys Midnight Runners , playing piano for their album Do n't Stand Me Down and two singles , one becoming the theme song for the TV series Brush Strokes . Dexys Midnight Runners disbanded in 1987 and Crane intended to reform Atomic Rooster with Du Cann once again . A German tour was planned for 1989. However , Crane 's mental illness intervened , and he died when he overdosed on painkillers on 14 February 1989. Paul Hammond died in 1993. All members of the band that recorded Death Walks Behind You , have subsequently died . Du Cann ( d. September 21 , 2011 ) struck a deal with Angel Air Records and has overseen the release and re-release of much of his and Atomic Rooster 's material , including live recordings , compilations , compilations of unreleased material and album reissues with extra material .
