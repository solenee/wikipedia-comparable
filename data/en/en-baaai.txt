History The boulevard de Sébastopol is one of the most important roads opened up by the Baron Haussmann during his transformation of Paris in the 1850s . It was conceived as a major artery running a north-south axis across Paris , leading to the Gare de l'Est . The road was christened Boulevard du Centre when it was opened in 1854. Following Napoléon III 's victory at the port of Sevastopol , in the Crimea of 8 September 1855 , it was given its current name . For several years , the name belonged to the road known since 1867 as Boulevard Saint-Michel , along the Rive Gauche up to Rue Cujas .
