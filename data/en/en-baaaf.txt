 It is composed of a neutron star accreting matter from a normal star ( HZ Her ) probably due to Roche lobe overflow . Intermediate-mass X-ray binary ( IMXB ) Her X-1 is the prototype for the massive X-ray binaries although it falls on the borderline , ~2 M☉ , between high- and low-mass X-ray binaries . Intensity The source exhibits complex time variability , pulsing with a period of 1.24 s due to the rotation of the neutron star , eclipsing every 1.70 days with the period of the binary orbit , and also varying with a 35-day period believed associated with the precession of the accretion disk . From observations , a twisted accretion disk , in retrograde precession , modulates the X-rays illuminating HZ Her and Earth . The 1.24 second pulsar period associated with Her X-1 is immediately evident from the data . The sharp cut-off at ~24 keV in the flat spectrum observed for Her X-1 in this exposure provided the first reported evidence for radiative transfer effects to be associated with a highly magnetized plasma near the surface of a neutron star . Discovery of Her X-1 The actual announcement of the discovery of Hercules X-1 by Uhuru occurred at the 1971-72 Winter Meeting of the High-Energy Astrophysics Division AAS held in San Juan . The original discovery of this periodically pulsating binary X-ray source occurred in November 1971. Location The position of Her X-1 was uncertain due to the failure of the Uhuru star aspect sensors , having been reported using OSO 7. However , there is only one weak X-ray source ( 2U 1735+43 ) within 10° of Her X-1 . But four radio sources : ( 1 ) RA 16h56m50.75s Dec 35°14'33±3 " of a double point source separated by 17±2 " and a stellar image 13±3 " from the centroid , ( 2 ) RA 16h57m10.65s Dec 35°21'35±3 " within 6±3 " of the stellar image , ( 3 ) RA 16h57m35.72s Dec 35°15'19±3 " with no star visible on the Palomar Sky Survey print , and ( 4 ) RA 16h58m39.17s Dec 35°10'53±3 " were found near the overlap of Uhuru and OSO 7 positions . At that time the search could not discover the radio counterpart of Her X-1 if its radio emission were analogous to its 36-day periodic X-ray behavior , although there was no compelling astrophysical reason for the two fluxes to be correlated .  The four sources above were observed during several eclipse phases of the X-ray star . No radio eclipses were detected that corresponded . At that time Doxsey specified that ( 1 ) repeated radio searches , especially during the high X-ray luminosity state of Her X-1 , should be made and ( 2 ) there was a clear need for a better position determination for Her X-1 . In 1973 , Bahcall and Bahcall determined that HZ Hercules had a light curve that matched Hercules X-1 's , fixing Hercules X-1 's position .
